I argue that if something is founded upon deceit and control, these economic tools and legislation are most likely still used as a means of control and corruption.<br><br> My arguments, historical and quantitative, are laid out across different pages on the navigation panel to the left.</div>

This fiscal control bothers me. <br><br> A great example of this would be the most recent collapse of <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX_(company)"> FTX </a></u>, a crypto exchange company founded on the ability to find discrepencies in international crypto markets and sell tokens for arbitrage. <br><br> The founder, Sam Bankman Fried has committed one of the most grievous accounts of fraud since Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, and the media and democratic party has protected him at all costs by allowing him to create a narrative across recent interviews that he is innocent and simply ignorant of the fraud that he so obviously committed. His donations and money is currently saving him. In order to find truthful information on the matter, ditch your NY Times subscription and try to tune into sub-stacks and podcasts such as <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU"> this. </a></u></div>

In my opinion, hierarchy is most often earned by merit, but is always preserved by deceit. <br><br> I do not wish to convince people that a ruling class is playing around with our lives like puppet masters, but I do want people to see that there are clear winners and losers in our current societal structure. And it's clear that the winners want to keep winning by beating us losers as much as possible. </div>

Late stage capitalism will require you to compete or die trying.<br><br> <u><h5> Introduction to Economics </h5></u> I have compiled some basic definitions regarding the most important aspects of how our rich stay rich and how our poor stay poor. Click through some of the links to learn some history and new economic vocabulary.<br><br> <u><h5>Economics Charts for Fun</h5></u> I wanted to practice a blog style report that included some data visualizations that could reflect on a topic that I was passionate about. This last page is simply some practice graphs that show real data of our current economy. The indicators I picked are not exactly groundbreaking or statements about the current state of our economy. But, they are more of a fun way to just see some some data from the previous definition. </div>
