# DIG 245 Final


We’ve looked at a number of interconnected issues around design and the internet this semester. Some are specific forms we can identify, like how dark patterns manipulate our experiences by affecting usability and user expectations. Others, like how the surveillance economy affects social justice are harder to visualize, but equally important when we consider whether the internet is or is not a positive force in society.

At the beginning of the semester, the [View Source](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-a2) assignment asked you to think about why it is important to be able to know how a web page works “under the hood.” This final assignment challenges you to further investigate one or more of your preferred themes from the course and make a creative response in the form of a web application that likewise makes the topic more understandable, relevant, or transparent.

Your application will consist of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and any additional libraries you may need, but it should address the topic through an interactive experience that involves a user somehow inputting data, and then your app changing and using / displaying that data to reveal insights into your chosen topic.

We'll produce our projects using the following timeline (specific dates are on the schedule).




## Part I. Brainstorm

Identify a topic, collect research, prepare a summary for a brainstorming session.

1. Identify a potential topic area you would like to explore. It shouldn't be too specific, nor too broad.
1. Collect related research (articles, etc.) and inspiration (list three similar projects with links).
1. Identify a new skill or technology (a design method, programming pattern, or code library) you are interested to learn and could potentially use in your project.
1. Write a 3–4 sentence summary of your topic, research, and technology. Address why you are drawn to this topic and why it is important we engage with it.


<pre>
In class: In groups (3–5), brainstorm on your topics using the <a href="materials/meta/article-brainstorming.pdf" target="_blank">Disney Creative Strategy</a>.

- The more ideas, the better. Brainstorming aims at the quantity, which later turns into quality.
- No criticism. Our goal is to generate a pool of ideas. All ideas are welcome.
- Follow the plan, which will ask your group to assume different "hats" in order to ideate on concepts, solutions, and risks.
</pre>




## Part II. Proposal

Create a pitch deck (10-15 slide Google Presentation) to share and plan your project that contains:

1. A one paragraph introduction to your concept and app you plan to make.
1. An initial attempt at an [identity](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1exnY8fjVsOc3bKZFESJIM2s4JKxhqg_oASPDPokSfrE/edit?usp=sharing) (e.g. a logo, word mark, or style guide).
1. Examples (2–3) of similar works (in concept or tech) with images and links.
1. Flowcharts (2) showing steps a user will take to interact and another to [show how data works](https://www.google.com/search?q=a+flowchart+that+tracks+data+through+the+app&safe=off&tbm=isch) in the app
1. [Wireframes](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/how-to-wireframe-website/) showing all the views in the interface (introduction page, forms, results page)
1. [Pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) of the main logic of your app
1. A list of the technology and code samples you think you will need, and a list of the "unknowns"—the parts of your idea that you don't know yet how to execute.


<pre>
In class: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">Lightning talks</a> of your pitches (5 min.)
</pre>







## Part III. Prototype

Create a working “proof of concept” of your app.

1. Your prototype should contain the essential functions of your project.
1. Your work should be live (not public, just able to be shared via a link in Slack)
1. Feel free to fork and use this repository to start.

<pre>
In class: In groups (3–5), share your prototypes to get feedback:

- Be ready to explain the current status of your work
- Bring specific questions or unknowns (concept, design, tech) you would like to discuss with your group.
</pre>





## Part IV. Design

Design iterations of all your pages.

1. The design should reflect the overall concept and goals of your project.
1. Use the Bootstrap `designs/1.psd` template included in this repo.
1. Create multiple iterations of each different page / view your app.
1. As per class [presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BiIHVEQjmIb2k2vB6N3x1g_S3KSLyZq2YCniq1ONjg8/edit?usp=sharing), look at relevant examples of good design to help you improve your own. Experiment and iterate!

<pre>
In class: Share your iterations to get feedback before coding the final design.

- What are three questions you would like to ask each user?
</pre>






## Part V. Deliverables

Your finished project should include:

1. Your coded design (valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)) combined with your prototype in a final application
1. The project should be live, hosted on Github Pages, Heroku, or your own server.
1. A well-designed, but simple page (preferably that is part of the project) to give your project context. This could be an introduction to the project or provided at the end to explain what happened.
1. A 200–300 word statement explaining your concept and execution.
1. An updated pitch (with screenshots and/or video) to document and share your finished project.

<pre>
In class: We will share final projects in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">lightning talks</a> (5 min.)
