# DIG 245 Final Project



We’ve looked at a number of interconnected issues around design and the internet this semester. Some are specific forms we can identify, like how dark patterns manipulate our experiences by affecting usability and user expectations. Others, like how the surveillance economy affects social justice are harder to visualize, but equally important when we consider whether the internet is or is not a positive force in society.

At the beginning of the semester, the [View Source](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-view-source) assignment asked you to think about why it is important to be able to know how a web page works “under the hood.” This final assignment challenges you to further investigate one or more of your preferred themes from the course and make a creative response in the form of a web application that likewise makes the topic more understandable, relevant, or transparent.

Your application will consist of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and any additional libraries you may need, but it should address the topic through an interactive experience that involves a user somehow inputting data, and then your app changing and using / displaying that data to reveal insights into your chosen topic.

We'll produce our projects using this [project development template](https://github.com/omundy/project-development-template). Specific dates are on the schedule.
