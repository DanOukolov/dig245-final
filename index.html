I argue that if something is founded upon deceit and control, these economic tools and legislation are most likely still used as a means of control and corruption.<br><br> My arguments, historical and quantitative, are laid out across different pages on the navigation panel to the left.</div>

This control bothers me. <br><br> A great example of this would be the most recent collapse of <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX_(company)"> FTX </a></u>, a crypto exchange company founded on the ability to find discrepencies in international crypto markets and sell tokens for arbitrage. <br><br> The founder, Sam Bankman Fried has committed one of the most grievous accounts of fraud since Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, and the media and democratic party has protected him at all costs by allowing him to create a narrative across recent interviews that he is innocent and simply ignorant of the fraud that he so obviously committed. His donations and money is currently saving him. In order to find truthful information on the matter, ditch your NY Times subscription and try to tune into sub-stacks and podcasts such as <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOEg4LbdTU"> this. </a></u></div>

In my opinion, hierarchy is most often earned by merit, but is always preserved by deceit. <br><br> I do not wish to convince people that a ruling class is playing around with our lives like puppet masters, but I do want people to see that there are clear winners and losers in our current societal structure. And it's clear that the winners want to keep winning by beating us losers as much as possible. </div>

The US and Syphilis in African Americans). In the dark ages, the collapse of society was caused by corruption of the church and elitest control over information. And just 80 years ago, there was an entire population of raging narcissists that waged war on the entire world in hopes of proving racial dominance and philosophies based on eugenics. <br><u>THESE TYPES OF PEOPLE STILL EXIST TODAY</u> (Ex. Jefferey Eppstein) <br> Yet, people still somehow settled on a risk analysis conclusion that led them to compliance rather than waiting for clinical data. <br><br> <b> What I Learned From My Experience In Business</b><br><br> Success is always contingent on profits, and profits are always contingent on deceit or control. <br> Profit is being paid more than a service or good is actually worth. In order to gain more profit, a business must improve these margins of value discrepancy. In order to do this, a business must either steal more margin percentage away from consumers, have some sort of market advantage that allows them the control to monopolize and control prices indefinitely, pay their employees less, or get cheaper materials through exploitation of those with resources. Therefore, naturally, success in capitalism is based on gaining competitive edges through control or deceit. <br> Yet, somehow, people still think that the elites of this world are not willing to gain a few bucks at the expense of human health or welfare. Whenever I talk to people about the possibility that the ruling class would joyfully control currencies, political outcomes, or our lives, they look at me like they are crazy. They are incapable of imagining that there are psychopathic hyper-competitve people in the world that want to rule over them. I find this lack of perspective and imagination to be alarming considering our extensive collections of history on war, business, politics, and human corruption. </div>
